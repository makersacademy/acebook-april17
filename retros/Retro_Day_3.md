# Retro of Day 1 of project

## What went well :

- Completed sprint tasks from Friday with 1-2 hours to spare to boot too. Great productivity1
- Following a mob debugging process when master broke was effective at dealing with the issue quickly.
- Pair process between OS & GLV was again really good, we used no gems and set up user authentication using 'under the hood' implementation. We also set a deadline to get the signin implemented by and kept to it, finding the pressure of the time limit actually helpful for focus.
- Trello is more under control, has been beautifully updated by JL to have a good colour system and with our next set of requirements.
- We had more in the DONE column of Trello at one point than in the TO BE DONE.
- Global improvement in app understanding and rails understanding.
- We had a very high level of communication, we almost constantly let each other know our status and strategy. We talked about decisions that would affect the group very openly and honestly.
- Carols continuing conquest of colonising chairs has been extremely effective.  


## What needs improvement:

- DON'T BREAK THE MASTER BRANCH.
- EVEN IF YOU CAN FIX IT
- EVEN IF IT'S 'REAL QUICK'
- No.

- We need to do smaller merges more frequently.
- To help the above we need to improve at breaking down features into smaller specs that can be merged easily.
- Estimation process - We need to link a time to our challenge rating and gain an estimated idea of how long a task will take. We need a new/better process for handling unknown tasks and how long we estimate them to take. Sign in is a great example here as we estimated it would be very easy to implement but actually took a few days!.
- GLV & OS need a better understanding of Travis
- We need to keep the eye on the commit history and speak to coaches about the master vs branch commit issue.

## what did we learn:

- Rails understanding has greatly improved all round but the below is the area of best gains:
    - routing
    - paths


- We learnt how to implement sessions correctly with Rails
- Our merging process taught us to merge to master one at a time rather than try to merge two branches and then merge them to master.
## Having fun?
- 4 Ticks on the board.
