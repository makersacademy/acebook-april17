# Retro Day 2

## What we learned:

- Carol gave Jacques a thorough and informative talk-through of the app's current state. He gained an excellent understanding of our current work, how it communicated with itself and how it worked, gaining a deeper understanding of Rails along the way. This allowed him to work on the app throughout the day fluently.
- Experimentation with routes provided Jaques and Carol a deeper understanding of the rails structure and allowed them to consider new approaches to the app.
- Onkar and GLV learned how to implement active record validations and return subsequent error messages in a format viewable to the viewer.


## What went well:

- Onkar & GLV paired on debugging the errors and broken code committed at the end of the day 1. They managed to get tests passing in places they could; removing one test provided to us that due to how we built are program was rendered redundant. A solid debugging process was followed and we overcame our feature tests for signup with a solid BDD/TDD process.
- In general BDD/TDD has vastly improved and we now have 100% test coverage and have covered for a good few edge cases test. We have also improved our commit frequency greatly as shown by the commit history.
- Modelling and User stories have been completed and given us a nice direction to follow from today.
- Jacques and Carol had a really good pairing session and as demonstrated above learnt a lot from each other as Jaques helped buff Carols testing process, both had a good day and implemented the post functionality.
- The division of work went well, with each pair giving the others functionality a wide berth in a strategy designed to limit merge conflicts when we merge the branches.  We shall test this stratagem in the morning.  

## What we would like to improve on:
- The format of the page, the aesthetic design, usually we would approach this task from a functionality first and form second. On discussion we felt that we would like to get some basic design added to the app to give it an identity.
- We still need to install travis.....


## Having fun?
