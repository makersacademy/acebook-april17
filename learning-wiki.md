  #####Week 1
  The learning curve was kind of slow, too many new things to learn.


  Despite this fact we managed to do well, both in terms of specifications and team-work.


  Few things I learned on week 1:

  
  * Rails folder structure
  * Rails commands for creating modules, controllers and migrations
  * Setting up heroku
  * Using github comfortably
  * How to co-operate better in team environment
