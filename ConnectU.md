### Planning

Backlog Refinement:
  Can be done at any time.
  Research tickets, split into smaller tickets

Tickets:
  Slice the cake vertically to split them apart.

Estimating:
  1. Use t-shirt sizing. xs -> xxl.
  Team should agree on the t-shirt.
  Tickets of sizes medium and up should be attempted to be broken down.

  2. Give tickets points, and team decides on the number of points to do during a sprint.
  Each ticket gets a number of points, a combo of factors ie. time/difficulty/familiarity.
  Each member guesses the points individually and shows at the same time.
  If there is a large range have a discussion. If still in doubt pick the higher number.
  The actual value isn't that important.
