#### Wiki

We have documented our entire journey on the Wiki of this repo. All page names are written in a format of 'MeetingType 00:00 01/01/2000'. Posts were made by individual members without agreement on a formal format. Each post summarizes the conversations had during the meeting.

## Deployment

#### Creation

Use
```
heroku create
git push heroku master
```
to deploy. Alternatively allow travis to use your repo and deploy when you push to master, with a working build it will attempt to push to heroku, you will need to generate your own API key and encrypt it for travis. This is done by running
```travis encrypt $(heroku auth:token) --add deploy.api_key --org```
for travis-ci.org or
```travis encrypt $(heroku auth:token) --add deploy.api_key --pro```
for travis.ci.com.

#### Database Cleaning

You can truncate the database by running
```
heroku pg:reset DATABASE --confirm { name-of-your-app-here }
heroku run rails db:migrate
```
This will clear and reset the database to working condition. You must have the required rights on the heroku project in order to do this.
