# AceBook

Acebook is a clone of Facebook built with Ruby on Rails as a group project during weeks 8-9 of the Makers Academy bootcamp course. To run the app on your machine, download the files, run `bundle install` to install the gems, run `rails db:migrate`, fire up the `rails server` and navigate to localhost:3000 in your browser. It is also deployed to Heroku at https://blooming-meadow-10813.herokuapp.com/.

To run the tests, make sure Rspec is installed (`bundle install`) and run `rspec` from the command line.
