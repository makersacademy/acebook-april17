## Deployment and Database
The app is hosted on Heroku and uses its built-in cloud database. For this project, we used Tom's Heroku account. You will need to be a Collaborator to be able to run / modify the Heroku app.

To run the app in the deployed Heroku environment:
* In your browser, visit https://fierce-headland-12326.herokuapp.com/posts
* Or, in your bash, run: `heroku open -a fierce-headland-12326`

To access the psql database hosted on Heroku, in your bash, navigate to the
project directory and run:
```bash
heroku pg:psql # Access the psql REPL
SELECT * FROM <table_name> # Display all table contents
```
