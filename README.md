## Tools used for this project

### SimpleCov - Provides Test coverage stats
* Gems used
```simplecov```
``` simplecov-console```
* It will run automatically every time the tests are run by running -
```bundle exec rspec```
* Check the results in ./coverage/index.html or on the console
* Remember to add /coverage to the .gitignore if it is not already there so that the test coverage stats don't get added to git.
