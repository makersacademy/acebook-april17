# AceBook

We have been tasked with developing a Facebook clone as a two week team project using Ruby on Rails working off a feature list rather than user stories. Our wonderful team is made up of:

* Benedetta Arinci (https://github.com/BeneArinci)
* Alastair Sumner (https://github.com/Sumner1185)
* Katie McDonagh (https://github.com/Katie-McDonagh)
* Anthony Donovan (https://github.com/ad13380)

# Initial Ideas

We spent the first afternoon of the project breaking down the first list of features that were provided for us into a number of tasks on our Trello board (https://trello.com/b/WN24QLdD/acebook-bits-please) and created an initial mock-up of how we expected our Acebook site to look:

## Daily structure

* 9:45am - Stand up
*	9:45am - 10:15am: Day plan & code reviews
*	10:15am - 12:00pm: Morning pairing session
*	12:00pm - 12:30pm: Pre lunch catch up
*	2:00pm - 5:00pm: Afternoon pairing session
*	5:00pm - Retro (daily review + next day's plan)


## Sprint 1

Features to implement:

1. Ability to Log in/ sign up: 
    * Ability for user to sign up with name, email, password
    * Ability for user to log in with password and email
    * Encrypt password
    * Log in/ sign up checks (valid password/valid email address)
  
2. Ability to post a message to the board:
    * Logged in users can post a message to the board (any length, just text)
    * Message comes with a time stamp on day written
    * Message comes with date stamp if older than 1 day
    * Messages appear on screen newest first
  
3. Team work:
    * Successfully deploy to Heroku
    * Ensure Travis builds are green
    * Get Rubocop set up and working
  
Each pair will take on responsibility for a feature, developing it full stack, and will work on it for the day, if there is more than 1 days work they can continue it for another day, however we will swap pairs if the feature takes more than 2 days to complete.

Bene and Al: ability to sign in/ sign up
Ant and Katie: ability to post message to board


## Sprint 2

For the second sprint we decided to change our structure so that each team member had the chance to work on all features and not just on those initially assigned to that first pairing team.

Features to implement - aim to complete all user stories from current Trello cards

1. Create Sessions:
    * Code should create a new session when a user logs in
    * Session should be terminated when user logs out

2. Posts:
    * Assign a user_id to a post when created so that they can only be be manipulated by the creator
    
3. Edit posts:
    * When a post is created the user should have a 10 minute window to edit
    * A user can only edit and delete their own posts
    
4. Additional features:
    * Create sign out link available on all pages
    * Users cannot add a blank post
    * Posts can have line breaks
    * Anyone not logged in should not be able to visit any page other than the index page

5. Testing:
    * Rubocop
    * Simplecov

By the end of this sprint we had completed all user stories so far. The only features we were not able to implement were:
    * Users cannot add a blank post
    * Posts can have line breaks
    * Simplecov
