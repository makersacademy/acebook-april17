See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)

## Quickstart

First, clone this repository. Then:

```bash
> bundle install
> bin/rails db:create
> bin/rails db:migrate

> bundle exec rspec # Run the tests to ensure it works
> bin/rails server # Start the server at localhost:3000
```

## Clearance
Clearance is being used to manage User registration.
This page has details on how to override some of the default behaviour (ie. redirects after signing in ).
Unfortunately it isn't that up to date.
https://github.com/thoughtbot/clearance/wiki/Usage


The [readme](https://github.com/thoughtbot/clearance) suggests to override the default clearance routes.
Thus we ran `rails generate clearance:routes` which added `config.routes = false` to the `/config/initializers/clearance.rb` file and a whole bunch of stuff to `/config/routes.rb`.

We then created `/app/controllers/users_controller.rb` which inherits the clearance Users controller and overwrites the `url_after_create` method to allow custom redirects. (We may add further overwrites to this file)

To ensure the router uses our controller we changed `/config/routes.rb`, namely
`resources :users, controller: 'clearance/users', only: [:create] do`
to
`resources :users, controller: 'users', only: [:create] do`


!!!

Added `require 'clearance/rspec'` to rails helper.


###Testing
Ran `rails generate clearance:specs` which added tests for user functionality (thanks clarence!)
Unfortunately needed a factory gem.
Ran `gem install factory_bot_rails`
Methods such as `sign_in` and `sign_out` now available in Rspec tests, in particular the controller tests.

Added `Rails.application.routes.default_url_options[:host] = '???'` to `/config/application.rb` which sets this for all of the environments (prod/dev/test). This was required to allow the 'Visitor resets password with valid email' test to pass.
TODO: Should probably be changed for production.

## Database Development
If you need to play with the development database in IRB you can use these commands to get stuck in with the orm.

Make sure you have a database first!
Add on any additional models if needed.

```ruby
require 'active_record'
require 'clearance'
ActiveRecord::Base.establish_connection(adapter: 'postgresql', database:'pgapp_development')
require_relative './app/models/application_record.rb'
require_relative './app/models/user.rb'
require_relative './app/models/post.rb'
```

## Rails Time Object, Freeze & Structure

### Freeze

For our testing framework we will need to freeze 'Time' be able to test effectively for posts being in order and timing out the ability to edit posts after 10 minutes have passed.

To do this I found a native rails helper called 'travel_to'

```ruby 

travel_to Time.local(1994)

``` 

In the above example we are setting the Time for the test to just after midnight, January 1st 1994.

### Beautifying Time

On our post index view, we wanted to see the time a post was created at, however the Time object isn't exactly nice to look at. To fix this, we used an formatting tool found below;

```ruby

strftime("%I:%M %p, %d of %B")

```

This, when called on a time object, will return;

`12:00 AM, 01 of January`

Here is a [resource](https://www.rubyguides.com/2015/12/ruby-time/) for the Ruby Time object and how to interact with it.
