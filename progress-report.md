### Setting up Heroku

- Deployed application on Heroku where the user can create, update and delete posts, and also sign-up. We also want code quality, code style, and code coverage tracked, with a CI monitoring integration.

### Blockers

- Setting up Heroku - pushing from master not branch
- Having to learn rails on the go

### Retros

Retro Monday 13/01/2020
Ellie and Harry:
- We should have slowed down and focus instead of rushing through
- In the end we managed to make it work
- We have learned a lot
- We have been persistent
- We are on track with day’s goals
Andrea:
- Enjoyed in the afternoon that they didn’t rush through starting working on rails, first they spent time learning
- Happy that they learnt something more about rails file structure even though they don’t understand the routing.
- Happy that they completed today’s task - time estimated well.
- Enjoyed having breaks together
David:
- Wasted a bit of time getting frustrated about understanding rails, could have found a useful article quicker instead of just staring at it.
- Understand much more now than before.
