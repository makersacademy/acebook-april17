### We will:
1. Have a standup every morning @ 9:30AM-10AM  
  * In this standup, each of us will confirm with the group what they're doing that day.  
2. During a sprint, have a retro every evening @ 5:30PM-5:50PM  
  * In this retro, we will have a brief overview of what each of us have done that day.
3. At the end of a sprint, have a retro @ 5:15PM-6PM  
  * In this retro, we will have a full overview of what we've done in the sprint, give personal feedback, and prioritise for the next sprint.
  
### Team principles:
1. It is okay not to know shit - let everyone know.  
2. When merging a branch to master, everyone must be present. This is so the branch creator can explain the code and we can celebrate a milestone as a group.  
3. We will conduct democratic voting to decide on disputes.
4. Respect others - treat others like how you want to be treated.  
5. It is okay to take breaks (max 15 minutes).
6. If no progress is done in 1 hour, consult team members before proceeding.
